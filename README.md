## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about solving complex technical challenges, especially in Python! I enjoy debugging tricky logic, building systems by breaking problems into smaller parts, and visualizing data with tools like Matplotlib. Iâ€™m especially interested in using data science tools like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and SQL to analyze and solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m motivated by curiosity, the satisfaction of building something that works, and the opportunity to learn and grow alongside others.
